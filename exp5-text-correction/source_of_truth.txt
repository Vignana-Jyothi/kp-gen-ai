The Ramayana, an ancient Indian epic, is attributed to the sage Valmiki and is composed of 24,000 verses divided into seven Kandas or books.

It has been a cornerstone of Indian culture and has influenced countless generations, shaping the moral and ethical fabric of the society. The Ramayana’s timeless appeal lies in its complex characters and the moral dilemmas they face, offering lessons that remain relevant even today.
The story begins in the kingdom of Ayodhya, ruled by the wise and just King Dasharatha. Despite having three queens, Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra, Dasharatha is initially childless and yearns for an heir. His longing for a successor leads him to perform a grand sacrifice, which is a turning point in the epic. This sacrifice is not only a display of his devotion and desperation but also sets the stage for the divine intervention that follows. The gods, pleased with Dasharatha’s devotion, grant him four sons, each born to one of his queens, marking the beginning of a new era in Ayodhya.
To obtain children, Dasharatha performs a grand sacrifice, and soon after, his queens give birth to four sons: Kaushalya bears Rama, Kaikeyi gives birth to Bharata, and Sumitra has twins, Lakshmana and Shatrughna. The birth of these princes brings immense joy and relief to Dasharatha, who sees in them the future of his dynasty. The princes are not only a fulfillment of Dasharatha’s wishes but also symbolize the virtues and divine qualities that will define their lives.
